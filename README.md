# 👋 Hi, I’m YugeniX

🎓 I'm a Master's student in Scientific Computing at TU Berlin, with a strong interest in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, human expression, and social values.

🔍 My desired research focuses on:
- How large language models (LLMs) handle human emotions such as empathy, encouragement, and guilt
- Human-centered computing and interactive AI systems
- The psychological and philosophical dimensions of AI-driven expression

📌 Current status: Finishing Master Thesis on M.Sc. Scientific Computing

🌱 I'm passionate about making AI more interpretable, expressive, and aligned with real human needs and communication styles.

🧪 Recent Projects:
- **LLMs and Emotion**: A mini study comparing how ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini interpret emotional prompts (coming soon!)
